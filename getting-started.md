# Get Started

[Supergood](https://supergood.ai) enables your engineering and finance teams to manage your external APIs. Monitor every external API in your system with just 2 lines of code.

To get started:

1. Go to [https://dashboard.supergood.ai](https://dashboard.supergood.ai) and use your work email address to create an account and organization.
2. On the left panel, click **API Keys** > **Generate API Keys** to get your client ID and client secret.
3. Integrate with a Supergood client. Supergood currently supports monitoring API calls in [Node.js](installing-clients/node.js.md), [Ruby](integrate-with-clients/ruby/), and [Python](integrate-with-clients/python/), with more languages on the horizon.
