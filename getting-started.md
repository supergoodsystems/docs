1. Head over to [https://dashboard.supergood.ai](https://dashboard.supergood.ai) and create an account and an organization. Be sure to use your work email address when signing up.
2. Head over to the left hand panel and click "API Keys", then "Generate API Keys" to get your client ID and client secret.
3. We currently support monitoring API calls in Node.JS, Ruby, Python and Go, with more languages added all the time.
